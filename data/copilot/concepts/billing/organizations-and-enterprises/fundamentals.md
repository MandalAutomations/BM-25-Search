## GitHub AI Credits

Copilot usage is measured in AI credits under usage-based billing. Each license contributes AI credits to a shared enterprise pool, and usage beyond the pool is charged at $0.01 USD per AI credit. Code completions and next edit suggestions are not billed in AI credits and remain unlimited for all paid plans.

For a full explanation of how AI credits work, including pooling, additional usage, and what happens when credits run out, see [Usage-based billing for organizations and enterprises](/en/copilot/concepts/billing/usage-based-billing-for-organizations-and-enterprises).

## Seat assignment

A Copilot seat is a license to use GitHub Copilot for a user. Each month, your organization or enterprise is billed for the number of assigned seats.

Seat assignment is managed by enterprise or organization owners. With GitHub Enterprise Cloud, an enterprise owner must have enabled GitHub Copilot for the organization before an organization owner can assign seats. See [Granting users access to GitHub Copilot in your enterprise](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-access/grant-access) or [Granting access to GitHub Copilot for members of your organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-access/grant-access).

If a user receives a seat from multiple organizations in the same enterprise, the enterprise will be billed only once, and one organization is selected and billed for the seat. To determine which organization is billed for a given user, request a detailed usage report and refer to the `organization` column for the user's Copilot license. See [Billing reports reference](/en/billing/reference/billing-reports).

## Billing cycles

Billed users are calculated at the end of each billing cycle, based on the number of GitHub Copilot seats that are assigned. You can add or remove seats at any time during the billing cycle.

When you add seats, you will be billed pro rata for those seats for the rest of the billing cycle. Included AI credits for the seats may also be prorated. If you pay by credit card or PayPal, you will need to pay a prorated amount upfront to cover the seats for the rest of the current billing cycle.

When you remove seats, billing for those seats continues until the end of the current billing cycle.

For more information, see [Making changes to your GitHub Copilot license](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/license-changes).

## Managing costs

You can control AI credits spend using budget controls at the user, cost center, and enterprise level. For an overview of how budget controls work, see [Budgets for usage-based billing](/en/copilot/concepts/billing/budgets-for-usage-based-billing). For guidance on choosing a configuration, see [Optimizing your budget configuration](/en/copilot/tutorials/budgets/optimizing-your-budget-configuration).
