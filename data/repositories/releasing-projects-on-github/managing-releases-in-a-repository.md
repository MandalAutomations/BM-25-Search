# Managing releases in a repository

You can create releases to bundle and deliver iterations of a project to users.

## About release management

You can create new releases with release notes, @mentions of contributors, and links to binary files, as well as edit or delete existing releases. You can also create, modify, and delete releases by using the Releases API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for releases](/en/rest/releases/releases) in the REST API documentation.

You can also publish an action from a specific release in GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see [Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace](/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace).

You can choose whether Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) objects are included in the ZIP files and tarballs that GitHub creates for each release. For more information, see [Managing Git LFS objects in archives of your repository](/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository).

## Creating a release

> \[!TIP]
> If you have enabled immutable releases for your repository, it's recommended to create releases as drafts first, attach all assets, and then publish. This ensures all assets are in place before the release becomes immutable. For more information, see [Immutable releases](/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/immutable-releases).

<div class="ghd-tool webui">

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. To the right of the list of files, click **Releases**.

   ![Screenshot of the main page of a repository. A link, labeled "Releases", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/releases/release-link.png)
3. At the top of the page, click **Draft a new release**.
4. To choose a tag for the release, select the **Choose a tag** dropdown menu.
   * To use an existing tag, click the tag.
   * To create a new tag, type a version number for your release, then click **Create new tag**.
5. If you created a new tag, select the **Target** dropdown menu, then click the branch that contains the project you want to release.
6. Optionally, above the description field, select the **Previous tag** dropdown menu, then click the tag that identifies the previous release.

   ![Screenshot of the "New release" form. A dropdown menu, labeled "Previous tag: auto", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/releases/releases-tag-previous-release.png)
7. In the "Release title" field, type a title for your release.
8. In the "Describe this release" field, type a description for your release.
   If you @mention anyone in the description, the published release will include a **Contributors** section with an avatar list of all the mentioned users.
   Alternatively, you can automatically generate your release notes by clicking **Generate release notes**.
9. Optionally, to include binary files such as compiled programs in your release, drag and drop or manually select files in the binaries box.
10. Optionally, to notify users that the release is not ready for production and may be unstable, select **This is a pre-release**.
11. Optionally, select **Set as latest release**. If you do not select this option, the latest release label will automatically be assigned based on semantic versioning.
12. Optionally, if GitHub Discussions is enabled for the repository, create a discussion for the release.
    * Select **Create a discussion for this release**.
    * Select the **Category** dropdown menu, then click a category for the release discussion.
13. If you're ready to publicize your release, click **Publish release**. To work on the release later, click **Save draft**. If you have enabled immutable releases for the repository, creating a draft first allows you to attach all assets before the release becomes immutable.
    You can then view your published or draft releases in the releases feed for your repository. For more information, see [Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags).

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool cli">

> \[!NOTE]
> To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

1. To create a release, use the `gh release create` subcommand. Replace `tag` with the desired tag for the release.

   ```shell
   gh release create TAG
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts. Alternatively, you can specify arguments to skip these prompts. For more information about possible arguments, see [the GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create). For example, this command creates a prerelease with the specified title and notes.

<!-- markdownlint-disable outdated-release-phase-terminology --> <!-- disable the outdated-release-phase-terminology rule since "beta" is part of the CLI command --> 

```shell
gh release create v1.3.2 --title "v1.3.2 (beta)" --notes "this is a public preview release" --prerelease
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable outdated-release-phase-terminology -->

If you @mention any GitHub users in the notes, the published release will include a **Contributors** section with an avatar list of all the mentioned users.

## Editing a release

> \[!NOTE]
> If you have enabled immutable releases for your repository, you can only edit the title and release notes after a release is published. See [Immutable releases](/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/immutable-releases).
