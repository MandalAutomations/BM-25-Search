# Creating a pull request

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see [Creating a pull request from a fork](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) and [About forks](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks).

You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.

> \[!NOTE]
> To open a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull request.

You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged. For more information, see [Linking a pull request to an issue](/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

## Changing the branch range and destination repository

By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. For more information, see [About branches](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch).

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

![Screenshot of a pull request. The dropdown to edit the compare branch is expanded.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-edit-branch.png)

When thinking about branches, remember that the *base branch* is **where** changes should be applied, the *head branch* contains **what** you would like to be applied.

When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.

> \[!TIP]
>
> * Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see [Comparing commits](/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits).
> * Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see [About issue and pull request templates](/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

## Creating the pull request

<div class="ghd-tool webui">

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.

   ![Screenshot of the branch dropdown menu on the main page of a repository.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/branch-dropdown.png)

3. Above the list of files, in the yellow banner, click **Compare & pull request** to create a pull request for the associated branch.

   ![Screenshot of the banner above the list of files.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-compare-pull-request.png)

4. Use the *base* branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the *compare* branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.

5. Type a title and description for your pull request.

6. To create a pull request that is ready for review, click **Create Pull Request**.
   To create a draft pull request, use the drop-down and select **Create Draft Pull Request**, then click **Draft Pull Request**. If you are the member of an organization, you may need to request access to draft pull requests from an organization owner. See [About pull requests](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).

> \[!TIP]
> After you create a pull request, you can ask a specific person to [review your proposed changes](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request). For more information, see [Requesting a pull request review](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be [merged into the repository](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).

To specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the `--base` or `-B` flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the `--head` or `-H` flags.

```shell
gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch
```

To include a title and body for the new pull request, use the `--title` and `--body` flags.

```shell
gh pr create --title "The bug is fixed" --body "Everything works again"
```

To mark a pull request as a draft, use the `--draft` flag.

To add the new pull request to a specific project, use the `--project` flag.

```shell
gh pr create --project octocat-project
```

To assign an individual or team as reviewers, use the `--reviewer` flag.

## Making changes to files in your pull request

After you have opened your pull request, you can continue making changes to the files by adding new commits to your head branch.

<div class="ghd-tool webui">

You can also make changes to files on the GitHub website.

1. On GitHub, navigate to a pull request in a repository.
2. On the pull request, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-file-diff" aria-label="file-diff" role="img"><path d="M1 1.75C1 .784 1.784 0 2.75 0h7.586c.464 0 .909.184 1.237.513l2.914 2.914c.329.328.513.773.513 1.237v9.586A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 13.25 16H2.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1 14.25Zm1.75-.25a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v12.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h10.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25V4.664a.25.25 0 0 0-.073-.177l-2.914-2.914a.25.25 0 0 0-.177-.073ZM8 3.25a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v1.5h1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-1.5v1.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V7h-1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5h1.5V4A.75.75 0 0 1 8 3.25Zm-3 8a.75.75 0 0 1 .75-.75h4.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-4.5a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75Z"></path></svg> Files changed**.
