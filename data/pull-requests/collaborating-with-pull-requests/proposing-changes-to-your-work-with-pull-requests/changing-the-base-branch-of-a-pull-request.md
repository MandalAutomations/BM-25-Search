# Changing the base branch of a pull request

After a pull request is opened, you can change the base branch to compare the changes in the pull request against a different branch.

> \[!WARNING]
> When you change the base branch of your pull request, some commits may be removed from the timeline. Review comments may also become outdated, as the line of code that the comment referenced may no longer be part of the changes in the pull request.
