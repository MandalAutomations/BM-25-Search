### Creating a branch for an issue

You can create a branch to work on an issue directly from the issue page and get started right away. For more information, see [Creating a branch to work on an issue](/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue).

## Deleting a branch

You can have head branches automatically deleted after pull requests are merged in your repository. For more information, see [Managing the automatic deletion of branches](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches).

> \[!NOTE]
> If the branch you want to delete is the repository's default branch, you must choose a new default branch before deleting the branch. For more information, see [Changing the default branch](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch).

If the branch you want to delete is associated with an open pull request, you must merge or close the pull request before deleting the branch. For more information, see [Merging a pull request](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) or [Closing a pull request](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/closing-a-pull-request).

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

4. If the branch is associated with at least one open pull request, deleting the branch will close the pull requests. Read the warning, then click **Delete**.

If you delete a head branch after its pull request has been merged, GitHub checks for any open pull requests in the same repository that specify the deleted branch as their base branch. GitHub automatically updates any such pull requests, changing their base branch to the merged pull request's base branch.
