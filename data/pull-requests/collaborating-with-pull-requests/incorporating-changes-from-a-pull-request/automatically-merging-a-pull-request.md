# Automatically merging a pull request

You can increase development velocity by enabling auto-merge for a pull request so that the pull request will merge automatically when all merge requirements are met.

## About auto-merge

If you enable auto-merge for a pull request, the pull request will merge automatically when all required reviews are met and all required status checks have passed. Auto-merge helps you avoid waiting around for requirements to be met, so you can move on to other tasks.

Before you can use auto-merge with a pull request, auto-merge must be enabled for the repository. For more information, see [Managing auto-merge for pull requests in your repository](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository).

After you enable auto-merge for a pull request, if someone who does not have write permissions to the repository pushes new changes to the head branch or switches the base branch of the pull request, auto-merge will be disabled. For example, if a maintainer enables auto-merge for a pull request from a fork, auto-merge will be disabled after a contributor pushes new changes to the pull request.

You can provide feedback about auto-merge through a [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/pull-requests).

## Enabling auto-merge

> \[!NOTE]
> The option to enable auto-merge is shown only on pull requests that cannot be merged immediately. For example, when a branch protection rule enforces "Require pull request reviews before merging" or "Require status checks to pass before merging" and these conditions are not yet met. For more information, see [Managing a branch protection rule](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).

People with write permissions to a repository can enable auto-merge for a pull request.
