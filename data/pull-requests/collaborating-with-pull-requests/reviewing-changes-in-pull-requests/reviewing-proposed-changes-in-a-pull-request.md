# Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request

In a pull request, you can review and discuss commits, changed files, and the differences (or "diff") between the files in the base and compare branches.

## About reviewing pull requests

It's best to review changes in a pull request one file at a time:

* **Examine** each individual file changed in the pull request.
* **Leave comments** on specific changes.
* After reviewing a file, mark it as **Viewed** to collapse it and track your progress.
* The **progress bar** in the pull request header shows how many files you've viewed.
* When you've finished, you can **approve** the pull request or **request changes** by submitting your review with a summary comment.

If the pull request was raised by GitHub Copilot then, when you submit your comments, Copilot will carry out more work to respond to your comments and will push a new commit to the pull request with further changes. See [About GitHub Copilot cloud agent](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent).

## Understanding the purpose of the pull request

Gaining a clear understanding of the motivation behind a pull request helps inform your review, so you can keep it targeted and meaningful, and provide feedback that is aligned with the pull request author’s intent and the project's goals.

There are several options available to you to better understand the context and rationale for proposed changes.

### Using the pull request sidebar for context

In the pull request sidebar, you can find valuable context including:

* Linked **issues** or **discussions**: Review these to understand the problems or goals that the pull request aims to address, or to gather information on, for example, any background, design decisions, or current debates.
* Linked **projects** or **milestones**: Review how this pull request fits within larger projects or upcoming releases.

Use this information to frame your review and check if the goals of the pull request align with the original intent.

### Using Copilot Chat to understand the rationale

You can ask Copilot Chat for help understanding the pull request’s intent or for clarification on any part of the change.

## Reviewing a pull request

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](/en/codespaces/quickstart) to test, run, and review pull requests.

1. Open the pull request in a codespace, as described in [Using GitHub Codespaces for pull requests](/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-for-pull-requests#opening-a-pull-request-in-codespaces).

2. In the Activity Bar, click the **GitHub Pull Request** view. This view only appears when you open a pull request in a codespace.

   ![Screenshot of the VS Code Activity Bar. The mouse pointer is hovering over an icon displaying the tooltip "GitHub Pull Request."](/assets/images/help/codespaces/github-pr-view.png)

3. To review a specific file, click the **Open File** icon in the Side Bar.

   ![Screenshot of the "GitHub Pull Request" side bar. A file name is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/changes-in-files.png)

4. To add review comments, click the **+** icon next to the line number. Type your review comment and then click **Start Review**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment being added, reading "Yes, I agree, this is clearer." The "Start Review" button is shown below the comment.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/start-review.png)

5. Optionally, you can suggest a change that the author of the pull request can click to commit if they agree with your suggestion. To do this, click and hold the **+** sign next to the first line you want to suggest changing, then drag the **+** sign to the last line you want to suggest changing. Then click **Make a Suggestion** in the comment box that's displayed.

   The lines you selected are copied into the comment box, where you can edit them to suggest a change. You can add a comment above the line containing <code>\`\`\`suggestion</code> to explain your suggested change.

   Click **Add Comment** to add your suggestion to the pull request.

   ![Screenshot of a suggested change. The "Make a Suggestion" and "Add Comment" buttons are shown below the suggested change.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/review-suggestion.png)

6. When you are finished adding review comments, from the Side Bar you can choose to either submit the comments, approve the changes, or request changes.

   ![Screenshot of the side bar showing the dropdown options "Comment and Submit," "Approve and Submit," and "Request Changes and Submit."](/assets/images/help/codespaces/submit-review.png)

## Understanding changes in a pull request

> \[!NOTE] You'll need access to GitHub Copilot. For more information, see [What is GitHub Copilot?](/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot).

GitHub Copilot can help you quickly understand the changes in a pull request by providing context and explanations for specific commits. If you’re unsure about the purpose of a particular change or need more details about how it fits into the broader codebase, you can ask Copilot questions about individual commits.

## Reviewing dependency changes

If the pull request contains changes to dependencies you can use the dependency review for a manifest or lock file to see what has changed and check whether the changes introduce security vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-dependency-changes-in-a-pull-request).

1. On the pull request, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-file-diff" aria-label="file-diff" role="img"><path d="M1 1.75C1 .784 1.784 0 2.75 0h7.586c.464 0 .909.184 1.237.513l2.914 2.914c.329.328.513.773.513 1.237v9.586A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 13.25 16H2.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1 14.25Zm1.75-.25a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v12.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h10.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25V4.664a.25.25 0 0 0-.073-.177l-2.914-2.914a.25.25 0 0 0-.177-.073ZM8 3.25a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v1.5h1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-1.5v1.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V7h-1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5h1.5V4A.75.75 0 0 1 8 3.25Zm-3 8a.75.75 0 0 1 .75-.75h4.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-4.5a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75Z"></path></svg> Files changed**.

   ![Screenshot of the tabs for a pull request. The "Files changed" tab is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-tabs-changed-files.png)
2. Above the changed code, click **Review changes**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Files changed" tab of a pull request. The "Review changes" button is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/review-changes-button.png)
3. Type a comment summarizing your feedback on the proposed changes.
4. Select the type of review you'd like to leave:

   * Select **Comment** to leave general feedback without explicitly approving the changes or requesting additional changes.
   * Select **Approve** to submit your feedback and approve merging the changes proposed in the pull request.
   * Select **Request changes** to submit feedback that must be addressed before the pull request can be merged.
5. Click **Submit review**.

> \[!TIP]
>
> * The **Request changes** option is purely informational and will not prevent merging unless a ruleset or classic branch protection rule is configured with the "require a pull request" option. If configured and a collaborator with `admin`, `owner`, or `write` access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request.
> * Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approving review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable.
> * If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed. The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged.
> * When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you won’t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.
> * If your repository requires approving reviews from people with write or admin permissions, the reviewers sidebar groups approvals by permission level. Approvals can appear in two sections:
>   * The **top section** mostly contains approvals from people with write or admin permissions that count toward merge requirements. Approvals by GitHub Copilot also appear in this section even though GitHub Copilot reviews do not count toward those requirements.
>   * The **collapsible section (if present)** shows approvals from reviewers whose reviews do not affect whether the pull request can be merged.
> * Pull request authors cannot approve their own pull requests. You will also not be able to approve a pull request that was raised by GitHub Copilot if it was you who assigned Copilot to the issue to which the pull request relates.
